3D MPI/OpenMP PIC Periodic Field file readers

This code is a sample program which illustrate how to read periodic
fields which have been written using simple Fortran IO by the mpbeps3
suite of PIC codes.  It is designed for Linux but will also compile for
Mac OS X.  The default compiler used is gfortran, but other compiler
flags are commented out.

No warranty for proper operation of this software is given or implied.
Software or information may be copied, distributed, and used at own
risk; it may not be distributed without this notice included verbatim
with each file.  If use of these codes results in a publication, an
acknowledgement is requested.

The makefile is setup to use gfortran with Linux.  It should also work
with MacOS X.

The executables created are called preadf3 and pvreadf3.

To compile the programs, execute:

make

To compile just one, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either: preadf3 or pvreadf3

To execute, type the name of the executable:

./program_name

The Fortran version can be compiled to run with double precision by
changing the Makefile (for gfortran, set the compiler options to:
OPTS90 = -O3 -fdefault-real-8 -fdefault-double-8).  This is necessary if
if the code which wrote the data was compiled with double precision.
